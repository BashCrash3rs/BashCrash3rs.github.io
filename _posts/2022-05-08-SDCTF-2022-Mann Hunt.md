title: SDCTF 2022 - OSINT - Mann Hunt
published: true

This was a really fun OSINT challenge that tasked us with finding someone based on nothing more than a username.

The challenge came with the following description...

We were on the trail of a notorious hacker earlier this week, but they suddenly went dark, taking down all of their internet presence...All we have is a username. We need you to track down their personal email address! It will be in the form <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">****.sdctf@gmail.com</code>. Once you find it, send them an email to demand the flag!

Username:
mann5549

## First, let's check the username with Sherlock -->

Since all we have is to go off of is a username, we need to leverage it to hone in a bit on our target and maybe some way to pivot onto another clue. The fastest way to get some groundwork laid is to search the username across a large variety of social media sites.

Doing that manually could take a large amount of time so we are going to automate this with a tool called sherlock. To run the check we head over to our terminal and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python3 sherlock mann5549</code>
